# Attitude Estimation

This project implements attitude estimation and propagation of it's covariance using raw gyroscope data. Three different parameterizations of attitude are considered i.e, Euler angles, Direction Cosine Matrix and Quaternions.

Refer [here](https://kvmanohar22.github.io/notes/w02/main.pdf) for mathematical discussion.

This is just a fun project. No real use anywhere. This was done for my own understanding of rotation estimation using the said parameterizations and deriving them from first principles.

The estimates are going to drift along which is clear with the visualization of covariance of estimation.
